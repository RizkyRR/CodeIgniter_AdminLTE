# How to Use Template
run it to localhost/CodeIgniter_AdminLTE/

I made a file on helper called template_helper.php. There are two functions, consisting of renderAuthTemplate and renderTemplate. Function renderAuthTemplate() for login, register, forgot password, and change password. And renderTemplate() for main template.
